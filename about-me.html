                        <p>In this blog, You will see a few places that I have been able to travel in my life. I feel so much joy when travel, because I get to see places ive never been and eat food I would have never tried before!</p>

                        <h3>When im not exploring, I am also studying to become a software developer.</h3>
                        <p>Along with studying at Scrimba in the front end career path, I am also studying at SNHU online to earn my BS in Computer Science. When I have the time, I would also soon like to complete the Harvard CS50 computer science course.</p>
                        <p>It has been a long time dream of mine to eventualy go back to school and earn my bachelors degree. After attending culinary school and spending years working in restaurants and retail after that, I finaly decided it was time to make the change I always talked about.</p>
                        <h3>How I stay motivated</h3>
                        <p>Scrimba has become a huge part of my learning and developement, and I can safely say that if I hadnt stumbled across the podcast, which lead me to this program, I dont think I would be as confident in where I am at this moment.</p>
                        <p>As the great Danny Thompson once said</p>
                        <p>Always be learning. Always be building. Code Code Code!</p>
